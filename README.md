# Make your perfect coffee guide / MS2
## This simple (but yet so important) webpage is made as a source for everyone who want´s to learn how to brew the perfect cup of coffee. The idea came from when I did´nt find any simple guides on the internet how to start brewing with a V60 pour over brewer, so I decided to build one by myself and hope there is someone who will enjoy it.

## Design Choices
Main main focus with this page has been that it should work perfect on mobile devices and the second is that I want the first impression to feel easly, almost playful.
Coffee pages usally uses natural colors with close-up pictures of coffee beans or pictures of baristas taking it very seriously. 
I wanted this page to feel relaxed and welcoming, without feeling unserious. 

### Fonts
When it comes to choose fonts there was two major things that was important, readability on mobile devices and playfulness. 
If the fonts where to strict the overall feeling would be too boring because the lack of pictures and other element. There is almost
only text in the guide so it needed to be something that booth where easy to read on small screens and playfull. 
The solution was to have two totally different fonts, one for heading and one for paragraph and smaller headings. 

Google fonts have been used for both fonts because is works seamless on all devices and are very reliable. 

All fonts is white because of the clear contrast to the backgrounds. 

#### Headings 
For the header title and H3 in the footer, [Sedgwick Ave](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sedgwick+Ave?preview.text=Coffee%20guide%20&preview.text_type=custom&category=Handwriting&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Sedgwick+Ave#standard-styles) has been used. It is playfull and works well on smaller screens when the font-size is pretty big, like headings. 
Under the process I have been used Google Fonts preview mode to see what kind of font that will work. 

#### Paragraph 
For the min content, the guide, [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?category=Sans+Serif&preview.text=How%20to%20brew%20your%20perfect%20coffee&preview.text_type=custom&selection.family=Source+Sans+Pro:wght@400;900&sidebar.open=true&query=source+sans#glyphs) has been used. 
Its perfect for content because of its simplicity and clean lines. It also looks great on small screens even when the font-weight is low. 


### Icons 
[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is the source fo the Icons via their CDN. Looks great and are very reliable on all devices. 

### Colours
As mentioned earlier, in the Design choices segment the challenge has been to combine both playfulness and credibility. 
The biggest design element on this page is the colours of Header, body and footer. When a stricter font i used for the guide, the colours needed to be contrasted with easiness. 
The decision landed in two tones of salmon/apricot #ffb294 and lightsalmon for body and footer. 
The Header is skyblue as a contrast to the warm pastell and looks great on all devices.

## Wireframes 
When the process started with how to communicate a simple guide that probably 90% of the users using a mobile with, the challenge was to create something very simple without being booring but also a clear guide without risk for misunderstanding. 
I prioritized user experience before state of the art functions. To set my ideas to a visual sketch with clean functions, I choosed to made it in [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/).
